Here’s a professional **README.md** you can include alongside your `automate_url_captioner.py` script:

# Automated Image Captioning from Webpages

## 📌 Overview

`automate_url_captioner.py` is a Python script that **scrapes images from a given webpage**, runs them through the **Salesforce BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training)** model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, and generates **meaningful captions** for each image.
The output is saved in a `captions.txt` file, mapping each image URL to its AI-generated description.

This tool is useful for:

* **Journalists & Media Agencies** – Automatically captioning article images.
* **Content Creators** – Adding descriptions for social media and blogs.
* **Accessibility Enhancement** – Generating `alt` text for visually impaired users.
* **SEO Optimization** – Adding keyword-rich captions for better search ranking.

---

## 🛠 Features

* Extracts all `<img>` tags from a webpage.
* Filters out **tiny images, icons, and SVGs**.
* Downloads and processes each image with BLIP.
* Outputs **captions** to a text file.
* Skips duplicate images automatically.
* Supports any public URL.

---

## 📋 Requirements

Before running the script, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers pillow requests beautifulsoup4 torch
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ **Default Run (IBM Wikipedia page)**

```bash
python automate_url_captioner.py
```

### 2️⃣ **Custom URL**

```bash
python automate_url_captioner.py https://example.com
```

---

## 📂 Output

The script creates a file named `captions.txt` in the working directory:

```
https://upload.wikimedia.org/.../Company_logo.png: the image of a blue IBM company logo
https://upload.wikimedia.org/.../Headquarters.jpg: a photo of IBM headquarters building
```

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Scrape Images** – Uses `BeautifulSoup` to find `<img>` tags.
2. **Filter & Validate** – Removes SVGs, icons, and tiny images.
3. **Download & Convert** – Loads images into PIL for processing.
4. **Generate Captions** – Runs BLIP model to generate natural language captions.
5. **Save Results** – Writes URL-caption pairs into `captions.txt`.

## 💡 Hugging Face Usage

This script demonstrates how to use **Hugging Face Transformers** for **image-to-text tasks**:

* `AutoProcessor` handles preprocessing of images and optional prompts.
* `BlipForConditionalGeneration` generates captions from image embeddings.
* The model is loaded from the Hugging Face Hub (`Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`).

---

## 📝 Example: Business Use Case

For a **news agency** publishing hundreds of images daily:

* Upload article images.
* Run this script to generate suggested captions.
* Review & edit captions before publishing.
* Use captions for **alt text** and **SEO** benefits.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Requires **internet connection** for downloading both the model and webpage images.
* For faster performance on large pages, consider **asynchronous downloads**.
* Works best on **high-quality images**.
